# odg-unpack
This is a simple app for unpacking LibreOffice .odg files. You drop an ODG file in and it will be unpacked into a folder next to the ODG file. Drop in a folder and it will be packed into an ODG file.

##Getting Started
1. ``npm install`` installs NPM dependencies.
2. ``bower install`` installs Bower dependencies.
3. ``npm start`` runs the application.

##Native Build
After following the steps in **Getting Started**, enter ``npm run build`` from the project's root directory. This will compile the application into native code for OSX, Windows & Linux. You will find the native builds in the ``build`` folder.
